# Espresso
A quick shot of ES6 instead that old Coffee. 

This is a command line tool for converting CoffeeScript files into their ES6 equivalents*.

*As close as possible, anyway.


## Up and Running
After cloning this repo:

```js
npm install
npm link
espresso --help
```

## See it in Action
```js
espresso examples/
```

Then check out the example `.coffee` files with their `.es6` conterparts.
